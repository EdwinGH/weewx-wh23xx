This is a weewx driver for Fine Offset WH23xx hardware.  These stations are
commonly available as Tycon TP2700, Froggit WH4000, Renkforce WH2315 weather stations.

Installation

0) install weewx, select 'Simulator' driver (as placeholder)

See http://weewx.com/docs/usersguide.htm#installing

Note that I installed on Raspberry Pi model 3+ (Buster) as follows:
0a) Add the weewx apt repository key
wget -qO - http://weewx.com/keys.html | sudo apt-key add -
0b) Add the weewx repository
sudo wget -qO - https://weewx.com/apt/weewx-python3.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/weewx.list
0c) Install weewx
sudo apt install weewx
0d) I also had to default to Python3 and install pymysql as I store the data on a remote MySQL server  
sudo apt-get install python3-pymysql

1) download the driver

wget -O weewx-wh23xx.zip https://github.com/EdwinGH/weewx-wh23xx/archive/master.zip

2) install the driver

sudo wee_extension --install weewx-wh23xx.zip

3) configure the driver (now select wh23xx, it should appear in the list of drivers)

sudo wee_config --reconfigure

I had to make some updates to the config file myself, for example remove the port. My wh23xx section of the weewx.conf looks as follows:
[WH23xx]
    # This section is for Fine Offset WH23xx stations    
    # The model name such as Tycon, or TP2700
    model = Renkforce WH2315
    # The driver to use:
    driver = user.wh23xx

4) start weewx

sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start
