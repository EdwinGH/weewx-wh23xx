This is a weewx driver for Fine Offset WH23xx hardware.  These stations are
commonly available as Tycon TP2700, Froggit WH4000, Renkforce WH2315 weather stations.

Installation

0) install weewx, select 'Simulator' driver (as placeholder)

See http://weewx.com/docs/usersguide.htm#installing

Note that I installed on Raspberry Pi model 3+ (Buster) as follows:
0a) Add the weewx apt repository key
wget -qO - http://weewx.com/keys.html | sudo apt-key add -
0b) Add the weewx repository
sudo wget -qO - https://weewx.com/apt/weewx-python3.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/weewx.list
0c) Install weewx
sudo apt install weewx
0d) I also had to default to Python3 and install pymysql as I store the data on a remote MySQL server  
sudo apt-get install python3-pymysql

1) download the driver

wget -O weewx-wh23xx.zip https://github.com/EdwinGH/weewx-wh23xx/archive/master.zip

2) install the driver

sudo wee_extension --install weewx-wh23xx.zip

3) configure the driver (now select wh23xx, it should appear in the list of drivers)

sudo wee_config --reconfigure

I had to make some updates to the config file myself, for example remove the port. My wh23xx section of the weewx.conf looks as follows:
[WH23xx]
    # This section is for Fine Offset WH23xx stations    
    # The model name such as Tycon, or TP2700
    model = Renkforce WH2315
    # The driver to use:
    driver = user.wh23xx

4) start weewx

I replaced the LSB init.d file with a proper systemd service file in /etc/systemd/system:
# systemd configuration for weewx
# created by EZ to replace /etc/init.d/weewx (removed this file)

# The following two lines are not in the current distribution version, but should be uncommented and used if you
# have changed the [Service] section to automatically restart the weewx service if it crashes. As noted below,
# this can be particularly useful if weewx has an IP connection to the weather station it is monitoring, since
# transient WiFi network problems are quite common, and may cause weewx to crash.

Then added by:
sudo systemctl enable --now weewx.service

And activated by:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start weewx
